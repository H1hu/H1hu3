						What is History?
						<br><br>
						History is the study of change over time, and it covers all aspects of human society. <br>
						Political, social, economic, scientific, technological, medical, <br>
						cultural, intellectual, religious and military developments are all part of history.<br>
					</p>

				<article class="col1">
					<p class="CFT3">
						Why is History Important?
						<br><br>
						Studying history allows us to observe and understand how people and societies behaved. <br>
						For example, we are able to evaluate war, even when a nation is at peace, by looking back at previous events.<br>
						History provides us with the data that is used to create laws, or theories about various aspects of society.<br>

					<P class="CFT3">
						When Did History Start?
					<br><br>
						History refers to the time period after the invention of written records in a given culture or society.<br>
						Archaeologists have discovered written records in Egypt from as early as 3200 BCE, <br>
						which is the accepted date at which history "begins" there.<br>
